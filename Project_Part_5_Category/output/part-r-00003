As a young man in his early twenties, he had a vision to develop a chain of cafeterias that would provide good food, good service and reasonable prices. Bob's vision was a product of his upbringing. In 1911, the year before Bob was born, his father, Harry Luby, stated the New England Dair Lunch cafeteria in Springfield, Missouri. Eventually, Harry's small cafeteria business grew to include restaurants in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana. By 1927, at the age of 39, Harry Luby retired from active management. Bob, who had grown up in the business and loved it, was determined to enhance his father's principles and work ethic in his own new ideas and passion for serving top quality food in a welcoming atmosphere. In 1947, Bob returned to Texas from his WWII service as an intelligence officer stations in California. Determined and driven, Bob joined forces with his cousin Charles R Johnston, and together they opened the first Luby's Cafeteria in San Antonio, Texas. It was thought to be an extremely risky venture since downtown San Antonio was deserted at night, and many people doubted that servicemen just home from the war would accept standing in line for anything again. The skeptics were wrong- the 180-seat cafeteria was packed for both lunch and dinner. And so the Luby's Cafeteria chain began. Over the next 11 years, Luby and Johnston continued to open new restaurants in Tyler, Harlingen, El Paso and Beaumont. An interesting challenge of their early expansion was not the availability of capital or land, but rather, the accessibility of well-trained managers capable of maintaining Luby's uncompromisingly high-quality standards. In 1959, with nine cafeterias in various locations, the San Antonio-based company incorporated under the name Cafeterias, Inc. It became a publicly held corporation in 1973, then changed its name in 1981 to Luby's' Cafeterias, Inc. and joined the New York Stock Exchange the following year. In 1987, 40 years after its founding, Luby's reached a milestone when it's 100th cafeteria opened in Round Rock, Texas. In 2001, two of America's most successful restaurateurs, Chris and Harris Pappas of Houston, joined the Luby's management team, continuing the company's commitment to high standards of excellence. The Pappas brothers each brought 30 years of restaurant experience to the organization, which included Harris' own experience working for Luby's as a young man in the early 1970's.For over 60 years, Luby's has forged a unique relationship with its customers. The emotional connection Luby's has with its diners is unlike any other restaurant company in America. Luby's success is due, in part, to consistently serving good food at reasonable prices. Another and no less important ingredient to that success is the understanding that meals can provide more than just nourishment. They can be memorable times that add warmth and meaning to all of our lives. Bob Luby's vision remains strong and continues to guide the company today, so future generations can create their own special Luby's memories. ",Restaurant Manager Job in Dallas,Full Time Employee,"Dallas, TX",Restaurant/Food Services,http://jobview.monster.com/Restaurant-Manager-Job-Dallas-TX-US-164648089.aspx?mescoid=1100043001001&jobPosition=7,"36,000.00 - 55,000.00 $ /year",Food Services/Hospitality,0c49d19b5a7e0ee5d091d8a5b8538fd7

Let’s look at what our company really does. Aflac plays a vital role in helping people when they need it most when they’re injured or ill.

Become a Strategic ConsultantYou’ll be the go-to benefit-solutions partner for businesses in your community. As an Aflac associate, you will be a strategic advisor to companies and their employees. Your role will consist of helping business owners figure out the best way to insure employees and guiding individuals to choose the best benefits options. We also have innovative tools to help you grow your business. Everwell is a web-based enrollment platform designed to enable agents to sell Aflac products, as well as major medical and other ancillary benefits from our partner carriers. Work with a Winning Team You’ll be working alongside a group of bright, energetic people who are motivated to help you succeed. As part of our commitment to your development, we’ll provide you with the training you’ll need to help you grow and manage a successful team. Become a LeaderBeing an Aflac agent allows you to own your own business while making a difference. You’ll have the opportunity to advance to a district sales coordinator role where you can grow and develop your own team. The Opportunity to Give BackWhen you join the Aflac sales team, you’ll be part of a passionate and deep tradition of helping those in need in your community. For 20 years, Aflac has actively supported the fight against childhood cancer, and has raised over $100 million to support the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta.1 Competitive CompensationAt Aflac we compensate our associates in several different ways including advanced commission, renewals, stock bonus, and a recruiting bonus. You’ll also receive renewals after the first year with 50% vesting starting at only 2 years.

There are also great opportunities to participate in contests where you can receive awards, trips, and prizes. So if you’re enthusiastic, self-motivated and have an entrepreneurial spirit apply today. About AflacIn the United States, Aflac is the leading provider of voluntary insurance at the worksite.
