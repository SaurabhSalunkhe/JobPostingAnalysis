The NYC plan to End the AIDS Epidemic draws upon the recommendations made in the Ending the Epidemic Task Force report (health.ny.gov/ete), and includes the following priorities: 1) promote education, distribution, and access to new medicines that prevent HIV; 2) expand delivery of new medicines; 3) support the social and physical health of marginalized populations, disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic; 4) enhance care for New Yorkers with HIV; 5) use state-of-the-art science to improve HIV prevention efforts.  With fewer than 750 new infections each year, the City will experience a natural and progressive decline in the total number of people with HIV/AIDS.
